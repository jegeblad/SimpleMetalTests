# Simple test/example of Metal

### Introduction

While porting an OpenGLES-based application to Metal for use on MacCatalyst, I have noticed lots of challenges. Especially, with speed on Intel Iris GPUs.

I made this simple example for testing and in order to better understand Apple's Metal framekword.

Use freely!
